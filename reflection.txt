I would say the most important changes made were the method for starters. The method was originally set to Delete which is not recognized so it had to be changed to POST. After that, making sure that the password input was visible and functional. Finally, making sure that the correct type attributes were present for the inputs. This goes into choosing the validation rules which was figured based on what kind of data each field needed. The control this provided kept things realistic e.g. making sure that someone didn't put a number that did not make sense for the age based off the average ages for a human.
The hidden password field was a huge security risk since that is how attackers can get past security so it was important to make sure that that was visible. I suppose if i could add something, it would be one of those "are you human" verification things with the picture matching.
